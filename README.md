# Intcode FCE challenge #

This repository is dedicated to solve a challenge from 
[Intcode](https://www.intcode.net/en/). Basically, we want to determine the
position of typos and incorrect sentences in some sentence samples, also 
we are to find the type of error according to the FCE exam board. 

There are 2 required steps in the challenge:

- [X] Detect in which positions between the right and wrong sentences there is
a required correction (implemented with a limited accuracy of 0.87);
- [ ] Classify the correction based on the labels provided.
